### Overview

This plugin uses Twilio Functions to create a button which enables the user/agent to pause/resume recording of a ongoing call.

When in a call, a "speaker with cross infront of it" icon is added to the Call Canvas where you can pause/resume the recording of the current ongoing call. This action executes a Twilio Function that uses the Twilio API to pause/resume the recording of the call. In the Flex UI side, a notification is poped up which shows the current call is paused/ current call recording is failed and the button is highlighted.
